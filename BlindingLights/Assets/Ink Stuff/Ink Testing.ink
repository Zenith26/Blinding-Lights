Welcome to Blinding Lights!
*"Who am I?"

-You play as a Wizard of light that's currently being overwhelmed by the forces of darkness.

*"Where am I?"

-You've taken shelter in an ruined castle, long forgotten by man. The forces of darkness have encircled the area and shroud your vision.

*"What are my powers?"

-You can radiate a small aura of light from your body. This light can be used to cast projectiles from your wand. These balls of energy can shed their own light to illuminate your surroundings and kill Shadows.

*"Who is my enemy"

-The darkness comes in varrying types and increases in strength as time progresses. They'll come at you from every direction, so stay alert.

*"Anything else?"

-No, you're ready.

*Let's fight!
